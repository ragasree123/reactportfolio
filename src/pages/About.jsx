        Hi! I’m Ragasree, a Software Engineer and Front-End Developer passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications. I love turning ideas into interactive digital products using React, JavaScript, Next.js, and Node.js.

With a professional background at Infosys, I worked on everything from optimizing infrastructure to enhancing user interfaces and resolving complex issues. Now, as a graduate student at UNT, I continue to sharpen my skills in web development, automation, and system design.

When I’m not coding, I’m exploring design trends, learning new technologies, and looking for opportunities to create impactful digital experiences. I’m open to Frontend Developer roles where I can innovate, collaborate, and grow
